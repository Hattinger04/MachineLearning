what action_size does alphazero have?


AlphaZero employs a different encoding for the action space in chess, taking into account the specific semantics of the moves to make the representation more compact and efficient.

For chess, AlphaZero uses the following encoding:

    Regular Moves:
        Every square (64 in total) can be a starting square.
        Each square has up to 8 possible directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).
        Each direction can have a range. For instance, a pawn can move forward by one or two squares, a bishop can move diagonally up to 7 squares, a king can move one square in any direction, etc. The maximum range is 7 (for queens, bishops, and rooks).
        So, each square has 8×7=568×7=56 potential moves in this scheme.
        In total, this gives 64×56=358464×56=3584 potential regular moves.

    Pawn Underpromotions:
        A pawn reaching the opposite rank can promote to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight. The queen promotion is covered in the regular moves above.
        Each of the 8 pawns can promote to 3 other pieces (rook, bishop, knight) by moving straight.
        Each pawn can also capture in 2 different ways (left or right) and then promote to one of those 3 pieces.
        So, this gives 8×3+8×2×3=728×3+8×2×3=72 underpromotion moves.

    Castling:
        2 for white (kingside and queenside) and 2 for black, adding 4 more actions.

Adding them together, the total action size is 3584+72+4=36603584+72+4=3660. So, AlphaZero's action size for chess is 3660.

However, note that:

    This includes many illegal moves. The neural network's output goes through a masking process where illegal moves are filtered out, and the move probabilities are renormalized before being used in MCTS.
    The efficiency of this action space, which is more compact than a naive 64x64 encoding, is beneficial for the neural network architecture and the computational efficiency of MCTS.
